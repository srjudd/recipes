Equal numbers of yellow and green summer squash, medium size. Slice,
don't
peel unless blemishes. Figure one squash per person on the average.
Roma tomatoes, one for every pair of squash, coarsely chopped.
Garlic, one large clove per 3 squash. Smash with flat of knife, trim
ends,
chop coarsely.
Dried or fresh herbs that work well with tomatoes. Could be oregano,
thyme, tarragon, I think Basil is a bit too overpowering.
Dried red peper flakes, or black pepper.
Kosher salt, or just salt.
Balsamic or red wine or apple cider vinegar. Balsamic is best, but don't
overdo. About 1/2 tsp at END OF COOKING.

When I adjust the seasonings the vinegar goes in first, I sometimes add
also add a squeeze of lemon if the squash tastes bitter, because too much
vinegar isn't good.



A skillet is needed for this. Can be nonstick, but doesn't have to be.

Heat skillet to medium high.
Cover bottom of skillet with olive oil, let heat for a moment but not
smoke.
Saute sliced squash until some pieces have browned spots. Don't overdo.
Add garlic.
If using red pepper flakes, throw in now.
Add chopped tomatoes, stir and cook until tomatoes begin to break down.
Add salt and dried herbs if using. Cook a little more.
If squash needs more time to be tender, turn heat down to medium low or
low and cover. Do not let burn.
Adjust seasonings, including adding the vinegar and fresh herbs if that's
what you are
using.
